# Rust Reverse Proxy

A high-performance reverse proxy implementation in Rust, designed as a learning project to understand Rust's systems programming capabilities and network programming features.

## What is a Reverse Proxy?
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and a web server, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server. It provides benefits like load balancing, SSL termination, caching, and security.

## Features to Implement

### Phase 1: Basic Proxy Implementation
- [x] Basic HTTP request forwarding
- [x] Simple configuration system for backend servers
- [x] Request/Response handling
- [x] Error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Load balancing (Round-robin algorithm)
- [ ] Health checks for backend servers
- [ ] Basic caching mechanism
- [ ] Request/Response headers modification
- [ ] SSL/TLS termination

### Phase 3: Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Metrics collection (requests/second, response times)
- [ ] Async I/O operations
- [ ] Basic admin dashboard for monitoring

### Phase 4: Security & Additional Features
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Basic authentication
- [ ] IP whitelisting/blacklisting
- [ ] Request filtering
- [ ] Compression support

## Technical Learning Goals
1. Rust's ownership and borrowing system
2. Async programming with Tokio
3. Error handling with Result and Option
4. Networking concepts in Rust
5. Configuration management
6. Logging and metrics
7. Testing in Rust
